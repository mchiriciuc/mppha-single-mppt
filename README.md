## Hardware Requirements

- **MCU**: ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1
- **Interface Board**: MPPHA (custom PCB)
- **Inverter**: Voltronic-style solar inverters (PIP series, etc.)
- **Connection**: UART (GPIO6/GPIO7) at 2400 baud

## Installation

1. Connect the MPPHA device to the serial port of the inverter with the supplied RJ45 cable
2. The inverter should power the board trough the RJ45 cable and a orange led should light up on the board
3. The second led should pulse slowly (aprox. once per second)

## Initial Setup

1. **Power up the device** - The ESP32 will create a WiFi access point named `mppha_single-XXXXXX - Setup` (password: `setup1234`) - Default IP 192.168.4.1
2. **Connect via Bluetooth** using ESP Improv in the Home Assistant ESPHome dashboard
3. **Configure WiFi credentials** through the provisioning interface
4. **Device auto-discovers** in Home Assistant

## Configuration

All configuration is done through Home Assistant after initial setup:

- **Battery Settings**: Configure voltage thresholds and charging parameters
- **Priority Settings**: Set charging and output source priorities
- **Current Limits**: Adjust maximum charging currents
- **Log Level**: Change logging verbosity for debugging

## Troubleshooting

### Device not connecting to WiFi
- Try the fallback AP mode (`mppha_single-XXXXXX - Setup`)
- Check WiFi credentials
- Ensure 2.4GHz WiFi is available (5GHz not supported)

### Entities not appearing in Home Assistant
- Wait 30 seconds for auto-discovery
- Restart Home Assistant
- Check ESPHome logs for connection errors
