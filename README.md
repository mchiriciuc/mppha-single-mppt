## Hardware Requirements

- **MCU**: ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1
- **Interface Board**: MPPHA (custom PCB)
- **Inverter**: Voltronic-style solar inverters (PIP series, etc.)
- **Connection**: UART (GPIO6/GPIO7) at 2400 baud

## Installation

### Option 1: ESPHome Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Open your ESPHome dashboard
2. Click "New Device" ‚Üí "Continue" ‚Üí "Open ESPHome Web"
3. Connect your ESP32-S3 via USB
4. The device will appear as "MPPHA Single"
5. Configure WiFi using ESP Improv (Bluetooth)

### Option 2: Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mchiriciuc/mppha-single-mppt.git
cd mppha-single-mppt

# Install ESPHome (if not already installed)
pip install esphome

# Compile and upload
esphome run firmware.yaml
```

## Initial Setup

1. **Power up the device** - The ESP32 will create a WiFi access point named `mppha_single-XXXXXX - Setup` (password: `setup1234`)
2. **Connect via Bluetooth** using ESP Improv in the Home Assistant ESPHome dashboard
3. **Configure WiFi credentials** through the provisioning interface
4. **Device auto-discovers** in Home Assistant

## Configuration

All configuration is done through Home Assistant after initial setup:

- **Battery Settings**: Configure voltage thresholds and charging parameters
- **Priority Settings**: Set charging and output source priorities
- **Current Limits**: Adjust maximum charging currents
- **Log Level**: Change logging verbosity for debugging

## Supported Battery Types

- AGM
- User-Defined
- Pylontech
- WECO
- Soltaro
- Lib-protocol

## External Component

This project uses the `pipsolar` custom component for Voltronic protocol communication. Ensure you have the component in your `components/` directory.

## Wiring

| ESP32-S3 Pin | Function | Inverter Connection |
|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| GPIO6        | TX       | RX (Inverter)       |
| GPIO7        | RX       | TX (Inverter)       |
| GPIO45       | Status LED | Built-in LED      |
| GND          | Ground   | GND (Inverter)      |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Ensure proper voltage levels (3.3V logic) and use appropriate level shifters if required.

## Troubleshooting

### Device not connecting to WiFi
- Try the fallback AP mode (`mppha_single-XXXXXX - Setup`)
- Check WiFi credentials
- Ensure 2.4GHz WiFi is available (5GHz not supported)

### No data from inverter
- Verify UART connections (TX ‚Üî RX)
- Check baud rate (should be 2400)
- Ensure inverter is powered on
- Review logs via ESPHome dashboard

### Entities not appearing in Home Assistant
- Wait 30 seconds for auto-discovery
- Restart Home Assistant
- Check ESPHome logs for connection errors

## Development

```bash
# Validate configuration
esphome config firmware.yaml

# Compile without upload
esphome compile firmware.yaml

# Monitor logs
esphome logs firmware.yaml
```
